#Projet 4: DÃ©veloppez Instagrid


Instagrid is a service that allows you to combine several pictures together before sharing it with your friends. It is available on iPhone (from iOS 11.0) and avaible in portrait and landscape modes.

The goal of this project is to development an application which the design and the technical specifications are already established. 

This project is incredible in terms of knowledge to acquire.

I choose to use MVC architecture, because is a famous achitecture that can help begginer as me, to organize the projet.

The collectionView and Delegates were two important notions to study during my learning process, they are very powerful and complex elements.

I also learn a lot about gestures, access controls, and sharing element.

The notions that make me in difficulty, were the animations and the realization of the border of the photoGrid.

To help me, I received advices from my mentor of OpenClassroom and also from my partner who is himself an iOS developper.

It is a complete application that needs to be attentive on many points, such as the adaptation of the different screen sizes and orientations, the rendering of the shared image, the effect of the animation and many others.

To do this activity, I mainly got information from [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4570776-creez-une-application-responsive-pour-ios), [Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/6308-beginning-collection-views), [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28152526/how-do-i-open-phone-settings-when-a-button-is-clicked#28152624), [docs.swift](https://swift.org/), [Haking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/media/how-to-render-a-uiview-to-a-uiimage) and Medium articles as [SWIFT: Code block to access iOS Camera, Photo Library, Video, Files in a jiffy](https://medium.com/@deepakrajmurugesan/swift-access-ios-camera-photo-library-video-and-file-from-user-device-6a7fd66beca2) from Deepakraj Murugesan.
